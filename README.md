# Test

You will be working on an application that facilitates transactions to beneficiaries. To successfully complete the test, you will need to implement the following features:
 - Introduce a new page to create a beneficiary, including fields for their first name, last name, and IBAN. Additionally, incorporate an IBAN validator to ensure the IBAN's validity.
 - Enable the selection of a beneficiary from a list when making a transaction.
 - Preserve the state of the application so that upon reopening, the list of beneficiaries, transaction history, and balance are retained.
